# Dia Browser - First impression

# What I like about Dia

	â€¢	Seamless migration from other browsers makes setup quick and frustration-free.
	â€¢	The custom skill system is a smart approach to personalize your experience.
	â€¢	Chatting with tabs is surprisingly usefulâ€”great for learning, researching, and writing.
	â€¢	Overall, itâ€™s well-suited for students, knowledge workers, and curious minds.

# What I don't like about Dia

 	â€¢	No ad blocker by default, especially on platforms like YouTubeâ€”this is a dealbreaker for me. (Brave remains my daily driver because of this.)
	â€¢	Opening too many tasks/tabs can eat up memory fast. Optimization still feels early-stage.
	â€¢	Trust concerns remain, especially given how the company has handled Arc browser.
