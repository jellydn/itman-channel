# Backlog.md 

- A tool for managing project collaboration between humans and AI Agents in a git ecosystem

### Markdown-native Task Manager & Kanban Visualizer  

---

# Why

- ✅ Most task tools are external — Backlog.md lives *inside* your repo
- ✅ Works offline, no vendor lock-in
- ✅ Uses plain `.md` files — easy to read, version, diff
- ✅ Visual + CLI + Web interface + AI Agent support

--- 

# Demo  

## CLI  
- `backlog init hello-app`  
- `backlog task create "Render markdown as kanban"`  
- `backlog board`  

## Web UI  
- `backlog browser`  
- Drag-and-drop board, live sync with Markdown  
- Export board with `backlog board export`

## AI Collaboration  
- “Claude, create subtasks for task 33”  
- Agent instructions live inside repo: `.cursorrules`, `AGENTS.md`
